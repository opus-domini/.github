# Opus Domini

**Practical open-source tools built from real-world needs**

Opus Domini is a collection of open-source projects created and maintained by [Hugo Andrade](https://github.com/hugo-andrade).  
The name is Latin-inspired ("work of the master" or "divine work"), reflecting a recurring theme across the repositories — simple, focused tools that feel like small but meaningful creations.

### Philosophy

These projects start as personal solutions to problems I run into in my day-to-day work (backend development, homelab tinkering, productivity tooling, etc.). When something turns out useful, reliable, and general enough, I clean it up and share it here.

Goals for every project:
- Single-purpose and lightweight when possible
- No unnecessary dependencies
- Clear documentation and easy setup
- Production-ready where it makes sense, but never over-engineered

If a tool saves me time or frustration, I figure it might help someone else too.
